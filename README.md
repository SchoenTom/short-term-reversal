# short-term-reversal
Empirical analysis of the short-term reversal anomaly using US equity data (1926-2024). We find the strategy generated significant alphas before 1990 (2.19%, t=3.17) but has weakened substantially since publication (0.53%, t=0.65, p>0.5). Includes factor decomposition, GPR exposure tests, and portfolio optimization.
